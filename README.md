# The Archives of CU Boulder Swimming & Diving Project
<hr>
<h2>Preface </h2>
In 1980, the University of Colorado Division I men and women swim teams ceased to exist. From the ashes of those previous teams, CU's club swim and dive team was formed. Over the course of the next 40 years, the history of the swim team gradually slipped into the void.<br />
<br>
Meet records were lost. Swimmers were forgotten. Databases were deleted.

<br />When I joined the club team in the fall of 2017, very little was known about the team’s past.Meet records only went back to 2015, and what little of the team’s history that was known was passed down via folktales from upperclassmen to freshman. 

In 2022, I was discussing one of those folktales with my roommates: Sean Butters and Nathan Shaver. At the time we were all members of the club team’s officer board. I was co-President alongside Abby Ulrich, Sean was the Men’s Captain and Nathan was Vice President.

That conversation would be the spark that ignited a quest to reassemble the long forgotten history of the team. Over the next two years, Nathan and I have worked diligently tracking down every article, every photograph, every meet result that we could find. 

We scoured long deleted websites, searched through school yearbooks, newspapers, microfilms and we even got permission to document the school’s athletic department archive. The process was similar to how I imagine federal investigators feel when they have to reconstruct shredded paper documents. It was messy, challenging and sometimes it did not seem like we would ever have enough pieces to put it all back together again.

But, eventually we did. It is a story of a team that has experienced epic highs and lows, tragedies and celebrations, but most importantly it is the story of the hundreds of people that have made this team so special the last 100 years. 

Here’s to the next 100 years!

Cheers,
Matt & Nathan

<h2>Website</h2>
The project began in one messy document. Meet results gradually migrated into the team website, which had a brand new archive page. Eventually, team photos were tracked down and team rosters began materializing. Unfortunately, the entire webstie was deleted and we nearly lost every meet result. Not wanting the project to exist in only a few google drive documents, we created the website CUSWIMDIVEARCHIVE.COM. This rebuilt website includes a remastered archive site as well as the club records, which were nearly lost during the website deletion. 

<br />The website still has a long way to go. Here is the timeline as of April 2024
