									<h2>6 Teams Are In, 6 Teams Are Out</h2>
									<p>August 3rd, 2023</p>
									<p>By: Nathan Shaver</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									The MLB Trade Deadline has passed, which means we're officially in the postseason hunt. As of today, six teams remain contenders:
									San Diego Ringworms (MacPherson), Culberson's Hair (Lenneman), Sandy Cheeks (Misener), Cron Zone^2 (Shaver), Bauer Outage (Guthrie) and The X-Men (Urban).
									Both MacPherson and Lenneman have clinched playoff berths, with Misener expecting to clich soon, needing either a win or a Drews loss. The real question is who will
									claim the 4th playoff berth? Let's take a deeper analysis. 

								</p>
								<p>
									Shaver, Guthrie and Urban are all in contention to make the final playoff berth. In the last 4 weeks, both Shaver and Urban have gone 2-2, while Guthrie
									collapsed to 1-3. However, the losses don't tell the complete story.

										<h3>Strength of Schedules</h3>
									</header>
									<p class = "imgText";>
										4 weeks ago, Shaver led the trio at 792 points, with Guthrie and Urban trailing at 775.5 and 782.4 points respectively. However, despite going 1-3, Guthrie emerged
										as the high point team in the trio during that time period. Both Guthrie and Shaver arguably had an equally difficult schedule, each squaring off against Misener and 
										MacPherson. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Urban's trial through hell has been saved for the final two weeks of the regular season. Guthrie and Shaver have a lighter finish to the season, each only facing 
										Lenneman once. For Urban to have the best chances, he needs to win all three games against Drews, Aparicio, and Dodson.  
									</p>

										<h3>Tie Breakers</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										With the exception of Shaver and Guthrie this week, all three teams are done playing one another. If Shaver defeats Guthrie, their tiebreaker will be determined by points scored.
										Guthrie, on the other hand, will be two games behind, so a tiebreaker may not even be needed. Guthrie winning this week's matchup would tie the teams up at 10-7 with the tiebreaker
										in Guthrie's favor. Similarly, Urban has already spilt the season with Guthrie, leaving the tiebreaker to points scored. Shaver and Urban are also split on the season, leaving a tiebreaker
										to cummulative points scored. 
									</p>
									<p>
										With so many tiebreakers being held to points, Guthrie has the best chance at winning any particular tiebreaker, being the hottest team by points scored over the past four weeks. 
									</p>
								</section>

									<header>
										<h3>Estimations</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Shaver's magic number to make the playoffs is 5. If he wins all 5 remaining games in the season, he won't have any issues. However just a single loss opens up a pandora's box of
										disasterous possibilies. It's possible for all 3 teams to finish 14-7, in which case the 3-way tiebreaker will come down to points scored. Guthrie's most critical game comes against 
										Shaver this week. A loss here would put him 2 games behind Shaver and potentially a game behind Urban. 
									</p>

										<h3>Rest of the League</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										By now, Lenneman, Misener and MacPherson are emerging as the clear favorites to win it all in September. All three of them have scored over 100 more points than Shaver in 4th. 
										While Aparicio managed to pick up a handful of wins, it is doubtful they will be able to end his monopoly on last place. Dodson by far has the fewest points scored against her. 
										Is it a conspiracy by the AI? We will never know.
