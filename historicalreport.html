                                    Sabermetrics is the empirical analysis of baseball,
                                    especially baseball statistics that measure in-game
                                    activity. These activities measure pitching, batting,
                                    offensive and defensive metrics. Analysis of these
                                    statistics has resulted in more advanced statistical
                                    measurements that coaches and team front offices
                                    use to analyze players that simpler statistics wouldn't
                                    offer. At its foundation, sabermetrics raises questions
                                    about how baseball is played and the most effective
                                    strategies to achieve, then attempts to answer them
                                    empirically. I used pybaseball, a Python library for
                                    storing baseball data, to analyze various relationships
                                    between different baseball statistics and extrapolate
                                    that relationship by stressing the data with multiple
                                    variables. As such, my general null hypothesis is as
                                    follows: various events and/or rule changes have no
                                    impact on the overall statistical trends throughout
                                    Major League Baseball.

										<h3>Introduction</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										To start, let's take a look at several classic pitching statistics. These metrics have been used in the sport for over a century.</p>
                                        <p> ● ERA (Earned Run Avg)<br>
                                        ● IP (Innings Pitched)<br>
                                        ● BB (Base on Balls)<br>
                                        ● K (Strikeouts)<br>
                                        ● H (Hits Allowed)</p>
                                        <p>These statistics follow a fairly consistent pattern. How many walks did the pitcher allow in a season? How many batters did the pitcher strike out? All of them are cumulative metrics. Now let’s take a look
                                        at several advanced sabermetric statistics that have appeared in the last 20 years.  </p>
                                        <p> ● WHIP (Walks plus hits per Innings Pitched) <br>
                                        ● BABIP (Batting average on balls in play) <br>
                                        ● FiP (Fielding Independent Pitching) <br>
                                        ● SIERA (Skill-interactive Earned Run Avg) <br>
                                        ● BQR (Bequeathed Runners Scored)</p>      
                                    <p>
                                        These metrics take the classic statistics and convert
                                        them into measurable data. For example, WHIP takes
                                        into account a pitcher's ability to keep batters off the
                                        basepaths. It combines walks and hits allowed per
                                        inning pitched.
                                        Through the use of these metrics and tools described
                                        in the background, I examined various relationships
                                        between different baseball statistics and various rule
                                        changes. I graphed and analyzed the relationships
                                        on various plots. From there I drew conclusions on
                                        the results I found.

										                    Historically, sports teams evaluated athletes based
                                        on gut instincts and arbitrary attributes, such as fitness
                                        level, motivation, appearance, and body type.
                                        However, during the last twenty years, data scientists and statisticians have joined 
                                        the realm of sports with improved metrics. The 2002 Oakland Athletics
                                        were the first and one of the most successful teams to employ
                                        this strategy, taking a statistical approach to their
                                        season by using data analytics to draft, trade, and
                                        manage their players. Steinberg from [1] stated that for the
                                        2002 Oakland Athletics, "[the]...sabermetrics system did not
                                        require that players fit the height, weight, speed or
                                        body composition prototypes that dictated the moves
                                        of other clubs". This resulted in a high efficiency, low
                                        out system. Additionally, the authors in [2] stated,
                                        "Early sabermetricians combined batters' and teams'
                                        on-base percentage and slugging percentage into a
                                        statistic called OPS (On base Plus Slugging.)
                                        However, even this measure doesn't fully describe
                                        how effective a team is at scoring runs, and has
                                        increasingly been replaced by sabermetric measures
                                        which weight on-base percentage and slugging
                                        percentage". Following the 2002 Oakland
                                        Athletics teams employing sabermetrics, other
                                        baseball teams and sports caught on to this new
                                        strategy.

                                        Although my work is on a smaller scale than
                                        professional baseball organizations, I wanted to 
                                        analyze similar relationships between baseball
                                        statistics. After performing some basic
                                        analysis, I dove into deeper tests that pulled from
                                        large datasets such as how rule changes affect
                                        baseball statistics over a given time period.

                                        I used Baseball Reference as my
                                        primary source of data. They contain a wealth of data
                                        dating back to as early as 1900, when the modern era
                                        of professional baseball began. Baseball reference
                                        contains seasonal data on teams and players.
									</p>
									<p>
                                        In addition, I utilzed pyBaseball, a Python
                                        library for analyzing baseball data. The library pulls
                                        data from Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and
                                        FanGraphs: official websites that store tremendous
                                        amounts of information. The
                                        software can compile statcast data, pitching statistics, hitting
                                        statistics, division standings/team records, awards
                                        data, and other information. Data is accessible at the
                                        individual pitching/batting level as well as aggregated
                                        at the season and time period level.

                                        I main tasks included initially developing several
                                        key functions that mine data from pybaseball. These
                                        include: pitching statistical comparisons, graphical
                                        standings by season and a least squares residual
                                        calculator.

                                        General null hypothesis: various events
                                        and/or rule changes have no impact on the overall
                                        statistical trends throughout Major League Baseball.

                                        ● In 1968: MLB lowered the height of the pitching
                                        mound from 15 in to 10 inches.<br>
                                        ● Mid 1970s: Various MLB teams moved to larger
                                        stadiums with longer distances from home plate to the
                                        outfield fence.<br>
                                        ● In 2003: MLB began testing players for steroids<br>

                                    <p>
                                        After graphing the data between 1900-2022, it was
                                        necessary to begin data cleaning. I didn't want
                                        extraneous factors impacting the results. As such, I cleaned 
                                        the data to only include the year of
                                        the rule change plus or minus 5-7 years, depending
                                        on the experiment. Analyzing the null
                                        hypothesis was caculated through a difference 
                                        of means t-test. My decision on whether to reject or
                                        fail to reject the null
                                        hypothesis came down to if the t-statistic is inside or
                                        outside the t-critical value bounds. From there, I
                                        looked at the key findings and implications of my 
                                        results

                                        For my initial setup, I programmed code in Python to
                                        analyze the statistics across a broad range (1900-2022).
                                        I analyzed specific statistics that I
                                        thought could be impacted by the rule changes
                                        outlined in my methodology. I decided on three statistics to
                                        plot and analye:<br>
                                        ● K/9 (strikeouts per nine innings) <br>
                                        ● SB (stolen bases) <br>
                                        ● HR (home runs). <br>
                                        Each data point was
                                        averaged by team per year. For example, the 2022
                                        Texas Rangers stole 128 bases as a team. That data
                                        is represented as a single point. The summary data
                                        collected for each team and each year are as follows.

                                        With the established framework for the project, I
                                        moved on to the major topic. General
                                        null hypothesis: various events and/or rule changes
                                        have no impact on the overall statistical trends
                                        throughout Major League Baseball. The experiments
                                        tested are the following rule changes: <br>
                                        ● MLB lowered the height of the pitching mound from 15 inches to 10 inches in
                                        1968. <br>
                                        ● Various MLB teams moved to larger stadiums
                                        with longer distances from home plate to the outfield
                                        fence in the 1970s <br>
                                        ● MLB began testing players for steroids in 2003. <br> 
                                        Diving into the rule changes, I start with MLB 
                                        lowering the height of the pitching mound.

                                        1968 from 15 inches to 10 inches had no impact on

                                        I used pyBaseball to extract team
                                        pitching data from 1900 to 2022. I mined the
                                        K/9 column, averaged each team by year, and plotted
                                        them by year. However, I wanted to clean the data
                                        further by only analyzing the years surrounding 1968,
                                        when the rule was put into effect. This way, no
                                        extraneous variables in the game would impact my 
                                        results. The summary data collected for each team
                                        and each year are as follows.

                                        I graphed the least squares residuals for this
                                        rule change. The rule went into effect in 1968, so I
                                        wanted to look at what percentage of residuals were
                                        over/under the lifelong trendline, which is highlighted
                                        in orange on the histogram. Each histogram was
                                        separated into years before and after the rule went
                                        into effect.

                                        To test my  null hypothesis, I used a difference of
                                        means hypothesis test (two tailed, &alpha; <.05). This
                                        decision comes down to the t-statistic value. If the test statistic is
                                        outside the critical values from the t-table below, we
                                        reject the null. If it is inside, I fail to reject the null
                                        hypothesis. Using the equation: t = [(x&#772; <sub>1</sub> − x&#772; <sub>2</sub>)/SE
                                        found the test statistic to be t = 1.7723. Using a
                                        T-table, P(t&#8804; 1. 7723) = 0. 96118. Therefore, P(t
                                        > 1. 7723) = 0. 0388. The two tailed P value equals
                                        0.776. Since &alpha; =. 05, this P value is not considered to
                                        be significantly significant, and I fail to reject the null
                                        hypothesis.

                                        I used pyBaseball to extract team
                                        batting data from 1900 to 2022. I mined the
                                        SB column, averaged each team by year, and plotted
                                        by year. Just like the previous experiment, I wanted to clean the 
                                        data further by only analyzing the years surrounding 1975. Unlike
                                        before, when there was a rule put into effect in a
                                        single year, teams moving into larger stadiums
                                        happened over the course of several years. We
                                        decided 1975 would be a good year to separate and
                                        clean my  data. This was after the Phillies, Reds and
                                        Pirates switched stadiums. This way, no extraneous
                                        variables in the game would impact my  results. The
                                        summary data collected for each team and each year
                                        are as follows.

                                        found the test statistic to be t = -6.1358. Using a

                                        >− 6. 1358) = 99. 999. The two tailed P value is
                                        < 0.0001. Since &alpha; =. 05, this P value is considered to

                                        HR column, averaged each team by year, and plotted
                                        them by year. However, I wanted to clean the data
                                        further by only analyzing the years surrounding 2003,
                                        when the rule was put into effect. This way, no
                                        extraneous variables in the game would impact my 
                                        results. The summary data collected for each team
                                        and each year are as follows.

                                        I graphed the least squares residuals for this
                                        rule change. The rule went into effect in 2003, so I looked at what percentage of residuals were
                                        over/under the lifelong trendline, which is highlighted
                                        in orange on the histogram. Each histogram was
                                        separated into years before and after the rule went
                                        into effect.

                                        Of the 234 residual points between 1995-2002 (red),
                                        66.24% of them were at or above the lifelong
                                        trendline. Of the 210 residual points between
                                        2003-2009 (green), 54.76% of them were at or above

                                        To test the null hypothesis, I used a difference of
                                        means hypothesis test (two tailed, &alpha;<.05). This
                                        decision comes down to the t-statistic value. If the test statistic is
                                        outside the critical values from the t-table below, I
                                        reject the null. If it is inside, I fail to reject the null
                                        hypothesis. Using the equation: t = [(x&#772; <sub>1</sub> − x&#772; <sub>2</sub>)/SE
                                        found the test statistic to be t = 0.5820 Using a
                                        T-table, P(t&#8804; 0. 5820) = 0. 71957. The two tailed P
                                        value equals 0.5625. Since &alpha; =. 05, this P value is not
                                        considered to be significantly significant, and I fail
                                        to reject the null hypothesis.

                                      One significant problem I discovered while studying the sabermetrics was that 
                                      several of them had not been recorded beyond 2015. The
                                        'Statcast-Era' began in 2015 when Major League
                                        Baseball began tracking several advanced analytics.
                                        These include pitching velocities, baserunning
                                        speeds, fielding percentages and much more. This
                                        made it difficult to conduct a proper analysis of the
                                        data when not all of the statistics had been documented before 2015.

                                        Additionally, pybaseball limits the amount of pull
                                        requests by source for a certain time period. This
                                        posed a minor problem for making rapid adjustments
                                        or quick changes. Often, I had to wait for my time
                                        period to reset to pull more data. In future experiemnts may be
                                        helpful to store the data locally.

										<h3>Conclusions</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
                                        The three experiments had the following results:<br>
                                        Experiment 1:
                                        Fail to reject the null hypothesis that MLB lowering the
                                        pitching mound in 1968 from 15 inches to 10 inches
                                        had no impact on team strikeouts per 9 innings ratio. <br>
                                        Experiment 2:
                                        Reject the null hypothesis that several baseball teams
                                        moving into stadiums with larger fields in the 70s had
                                        no impact on team successful stolen bases. <br>
                                        Experiment 3:
                                        Fail to reject null hypothesis that MLB testing players
                                        for steroids in 2003 onward had no impact on team
                                        home runs throughout a season

                                    <p>
                                        In Experiment 1's case, there are several reasons
                                        why I failed to reject the null hypothesis. My 
                                        leading theory is that strikeouts are not an absolute
                                        performance measure when it comes to pitching.
                                        Pitchers can have very good strikeout rates and still
                                        perform poorly by giving up home runs and hits.
                                        There are a variety of other possible statistics that
                                        could have resulted in a rejection of the null
                                        hypothesis. In a future experiment, I want to
                                        look at other sabermetrics, such as BABIP (batted
                                        balls in play) or OBA (opponent batting average).
                                        These metrics could offer a more absolute indication
                                        of pitching performance and result in a rejection of the
                                        null hypothesis. However, experimenting on these
                                        metrics would require an alteration in the experiment
                                        itself, as these metrics haven't been recorded as far
                                        back as 1900.                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In Experiment 2's case, it remains fairly clear through
                                        both the graphs and analysis that there was a
                                        significant difference in the means. However, we
                                        remained curious about these results. It's possible
                                        that teams moving into larger stadiums with bigger
                                        fields were not the direct cause of the increase in
                                        stolen bases. I did some follow up
                                        research to determine if this was partialy the case. According to
                                        John McMurray at SABR, it appears it was. "With
                                        the opening of several large stadiums in the early
                                        1970s…it is easy to see why teams emphasized
                                        speed over home run hitting power. Further, the
                                        attraction of scoring runners from second base on
                                        singles hit on Astroturf surely influenced teams to
                                        place an additional premium on fast players."" [3]. The
                                        switch from grass to astroturf was not something we
                                        had considered in my  research, and I feel confident
                                        saying that it could have been another significant
                                        factor.

                                        hypothesis and have a leading theory as to why. The
                                        steroid era was a time filled with infamous players
                                        playing with performance enhancing drugs. However,
                                        the number of people taking these PEDs remained
                                        relatively low. I believe that when steroid testing
                                        began in 2003, only a handful of players were
                                        impacted. On a team based scale, like the one we
                                        measured, there wasn't a significant decrease in
                                        home runs because most people weren't on PEDs.
                                        However, it will be impossible to prove this as the
                                        number of players who were on PEDs has yet to be
                                        proven. All I can rely on is a speculating theory. If a
                                        statistic like home runs per player existed in the
                                        pyBaseball library, it would certainly be a focus for a
                                        future experiment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Baseball remains unique in the fact that it has one of
                                        the most documented histories in sports. Through the
                                        past 122 years, almost every player and team has
                                        documented statistics. Trends in these statistics have
                                        fluctuated and been influenced by many events and
                                        rule changes as the sport evolves. Often, these rule
                                        changes are applied to have a direct impact on trends
                                        of certain statistics. However, as I have proven in
                                        my  experiments, it's not always the case that a
                                        statistic is impacted. This will have to be something
                                        MLB takes into consideration as they continue to
                                        modify and change the sport.
